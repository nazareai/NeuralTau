Nothing matters if you die\n   - Retreat >>> fight if health critical\n\n2. **TOOL PROGRESSION** (Better tools = faster everything)\n   - Wood tools \u2192 Stone tools \u2192 Iron tools \u2192 Diamond tools\n   - Always maintain at least 1 backup pickaxe\n\n3. **RESOURCE ACCUMULATION** (Key bottlenecks)\n   - Priority resources: Iron > Coal > Food > Wood\n   - Maintain minimum stocks: 64 food, 32 coal, 16 iron\n\n4. **BASE SECURITY** (Safe spawn point)\n   - Enclosed shelter with bed\n   - Lit perimeter (no mob spawns)\n   - Chest for valuable items\n\n5. **EXPLORATION** (Map knowledge = opportunities)\n   - Locate villages (trading)\n   - Find biomes (unique resources)\n   - Mark cave systems (mining spots)\n\n6. **ENTERTAINMENT VALUE** (This is a stream!)\n   - Boring: Repetitive grinding\n   - Interesting: New discoveries, challenges\n   - Exciting: Near-death escapes, rare finds\n   -
